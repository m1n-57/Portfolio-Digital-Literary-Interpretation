If my vanity had taken a\n","musical turn, you would have been invaluable; but as it is, I would\n","really rather not sit down before those who must be in the habit of\n","hearing the very best performers.” On Miss Lucas’s persevering, however,\n","she added, “Very well; if it must be so, it must.” And gravely glancing\n","at Mr. Darcy, “There is a very fine old saying, which everybody here is\n","of course familiar with--‘Keep your breath to cool your porridge,’--and\n","I shall keep mine to swell my song.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 178] Her performance was pleasing, though by no means capital. After a song\n","or two, and before she could reply to the entreaties of several that she\n","would sing again, she was eagerly succeeded at the instrument by her\n","sister Mary, who having, in consequence of being the only plain one in\n","the family, worked hard for knowledge and accomplishments, was always\n","impatient for display.\n","\n","[Paragraph 179] Mary had neither genius nor taste; and though vanity had given her\n","application, it had given her likewise a pedantic air and conceited\n","manner, which would have injured a higher degree of excellence than she\n","had reached. Elizabeth, easy and unaffected, had been listened to with\n","much more pleasure, though not playing half so well; and Mary, at the\n","end of a long concerto, was glad to purchase praise and gratitude by\n","Scotch and Irish airs, at the request of her younger sisters, who with\n","some of the Lucases, and two or three officers, joined eagerly in\n","dancing at one end of the room.\n","\n","[Paragraph 180] Mr. Darcy stood near them in silent indignation at such a mode of\n","passing the evening, to the exclusion of all conversation, and was too\n","much engrossed by his own thoughts to perceive that Sir William Lucas\n","was his neighbour, till Sir William thus began:--\n","\n","[Paragraph 181] “What a charming amusement for young people this is, Mr. Darcy! There is\n","nothing like dancing, after all. I consider it as one of the first\n","refinements of polished societies.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 182] “Certainly, sir; and it has the advantage also of being in vogue amongst\n","the less polished societies of the world: every savage can dance.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 183] Sir William only smiled. “Your friend performs delightfully,” he\n","continued, after a pause, on seeing Bingley join the group; “and I doubt\n","not that you are an adept in the science yourself, Mr. Darcy.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 184] “You saw me dance at Meryton, I believe, sir.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 185] “Yes, indeed, and received no inconsiderable pleasure from the sight. Do\n","you often dance at St. James’s?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 186] “Never, sir.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 187] “Do you not think it would be a proper compliment to the place?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 188] “It is a compliment which I never pay to any place if I can avoid it.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 189] “You have a house in town, I conclude?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 190] Mr. Darcy bowed.\n","\n","[Paragraph 191] “I had once some thoughts of fixing in town myself, for I am fond of\n","superior society; but I did not feel quite certain that the air of\n","London would agree with Lady Lucas.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 192] He paused in hopes of an answer: but his companion was not disposed to\n","make any; and Elizabeth at that instant moving towards them, he was\n","struck with the notion of doing a very gallant thing, and called out to\n","her,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 193] “My dear Miss Eliza, why are not you dancing? Mr. Darcy, you must allow\n","me to present this young lady to you as a very desirable partner. You\n","cannot refuse to dance, I am sure, when so much beauty is before you.”\n","And, taking her hand, he would have given it to Mr. Darcy, who, though\n","extremely surprised, was not unwilling to receive it, when she instantly\n","drew back, and said with some discomposure to Sir William,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 194] “Indeed, sir, I have not the least intention of dancing. I entreat you\n","not to suppose that I moved this way in order to beg for a partner.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 195] Mr. Darcy, with grave propriety, requested to be allowed the honour of\n","her hand, but in vain. Elizabeth was determined; nor did Sir William at\n","all shake her purpose by his attempt at persuasion.\n","\n","[Paragraph 196] “You excel so much in the dance, Miss Eliza, that it is cruel to deny me\n","the happiness of seeing you; and though this gentleman dislikes the\n","amusement in general, he can have no objection, I am sure, to oblige us\n","for one half hour.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 197] “Mr. Darcy is all politeness,” said Elizabeth, smiling.\n","\n","[Paragraph 198] “He is, indeed: but considering the inducement, my dear Miss Eliza, we\n","cannot wonder at his complaisance; for who would object to such a\n","partner?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 199] Elizabeth looked archly, and turned away. Her resistance had not injured\n","her with the gentleman, and he was thinking of her with some\n","complacency, when thus accosted by Miss Bingley,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 200] “I can guess the subject of your reverie.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 201] “I should imagine not.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 202] “You are considering how insupportable it would be to pass many\n","evenings in this manner,--in such society; and, indeed, I am quite of\n","your opinion. I was never more annoyed! The insipidity, and yet the\n","noise--the nothingness, and yet the self-importance, of all these\n","people! What would I give to hear your strictures on them!”\n","\n","[Paragraph 203] “Your conjecture is totally wrong, I assure you. My mind was more\n","agreeably engaged. I have been meditating on the very great pleasure\n","which a pair of fine eyes in the face of a pretty woman can bestow.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 204] Miss Bingley immediately fixed her eyes on his face, and desired he\n","would tell her what lady had the credit of inspiring such reflections.\n","Mr. Darcy replied, with great intrepidity,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 205] “Miss Elizabeth Bennet.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 206] “Miss Elizabeth Bennet!” repeated Miss Bingley. “I am all astonishment.\n","How long has she been such a favourite? and pray when am I to wish you\n","joy?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 207] “That is exactly the question which I expected you to ask. A lady’s\n","imagination is very rapid; it jumps from admiration to love, from love\n","to matrimony, in a moment. I knew you would be wishing me joy.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 208] “Nay, if you are so serious about it, I shall consider the matter as\n","absolutely settled. You will have a charming mother-in-law, indeed, and\n","of course she will be always at Pemberley with you.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 209] He listened to her with perfect indifference, while she chose to\n","entertain herself in this manner; and as his composure convinced her\n","that all was safe, her wit flowed along.\n","\n","[Paragraph 210] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 211] “A note for Miss Bennet”\n","\n","[Paragraph 212] [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n","\n","[Paragraph 213] CHAPTER VII.\n","\n","[Paragraph 214] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 215] Mr. Bennet’s property consisted almost entirely in an estate of two\n","thousand a year, which, unfortunately for his daughters, was entailed,\n","in default of heirs male, on a distant relation; and their mother’s\n","fortune, though ample for her situation in life, could but ill supply\n","the deficiency of his. Her father had been an attorney in Meryton, and\n","had left her four thousand pounds.\n","\n","[Paragraph 216] She had a sister married to a Mr. Philips, who had been a clerk to their\n","father and succeeded him in the business, and a brother settled in\n","London in a respectable line of trade.\n","\n","[Paragraph 217] The village of Longbourn was only one mile from Meryton; a most\n","convenient distance for the young ladies, who were usually tempted\n","thither three or four times a week, to pay their duty to their aunt, and\n","to a milliner’s shop just over the way. The two youngest of the family,\n","Catherine and Lydia, were particularly frequent in these attentions:\n","their minds were more vacant than their sisters’, and when nothing\n","better offered, a walk to Meryton was necessary to amuse their morning\n","hours and furnish conversation for the evening; and, however bare of\n","news the country in general might be, they always contrived to learn\n","some from their aunt. At present, indeed, they were well supplied both\n","with news and happiness by the recent arrival of a militia regiment in\n","the neighbourhood; it was to remain the whole winter, and Meryton was\n","the head-quarters.\n","\n","[Paragraph 218] Their visits to Mrs. Philips were now productive of the most interesting\n","intelligence. Every day added something to their knowledge of the\n","officers’ names and connections. Their lodgings were not long a secret,\n","and at length they began to know the officers themselves. Mr. Philips\n","visited them all, and this opened to his nieces a source of felicity\n","unknown before. They could talk of nothing but officers; and Mr.\n","Bingley’s large fortune, the mention of which gave animation to their\n","mother, was worthless in their eyes when opposed to the regimentals of\n","an ensign.\n","\n","[Paragraph 219] After listening one morning to their effusions on this subject, Mr.\n","Bennet coolly observed,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 220] “From all that I can collect by your manner of talking, you must be two\n","of the silliest girls in the country. I have suspected it some time, but\n","I am now convinced.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 221] Catherine was disconcerted, and made no answer; but Lydia, with perfect\n","indifference, continued to express her admiration of Captain Carter, and\n","her hope of seeing him in the course of the day, as he was going the\n","next morning to London.\n","\n","[Paragraph 222] “I am astonished, my dear,” said Mrs. Bennet, “that you should be so\n","ready to think your own children silly. If I wished to think slightingly\n","of anybody’s children, it should not be of my own, however.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 223] “If my children are silly, I must hope to be always sensible of it.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 224] “Yes; but as it happens, they are all of them very clever.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 225] “This is the only point, I flatter myself, on which we do not agree. I\n","had hoped that our sentiments coincided in every particular, but I must\n","so far differ from you as to think our two youngest daughters uncommonly\n","foolish.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 226] “My dear Mr. Bennet, you must not expect such girls to have the sense of\n","their father and mother. When they get to our age, I dare say they will\n","not think about officers any more than we do. I remember the time when I\n","liked a red coat myself very well--and, indeed, so I do still at my\n","heart; and if a smart young colonel, with five or six thousand a year,\n","should want one of my girls, I shall not say nay to him; and I thought\n","Colonel Forster looked very becoming the other night at Sir William’s in\n","his regimentals.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 227] “Mamma,” cried Lydia, “my aunt says that Colonel Forster and Captain\n","Carter do not go so often to Miss Watson’s as they did when they first\n","came; she sees them now very often standing in Clarke’s library.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 228] Mrs. Bennet was prevented replying by the entrance of the footman with a\n","note for Miss Bennet; it came from Netherfield, and the servant waited\n","for an answer. Mrs. Bennet’s eyes sparkled with pleasure, and she was\n","eagerly calling out, while her daughter read,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 229] “Well, Jane, who is it from? What is it about? What does he say? Well,\n","Jane, make haste and tell us; make haste, my love.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 230] “It is from Miss Bingley,” said Jane, and then read it aloud.\n","\n","[Paragraph 231] /* NIND “My dear friend, */\n","\n","[Paragraph 232] “If you are not so compassionate as to dine to-day with Louisa and\n","     me, we shall be in danger of hating each other for the rest of our\n","     lives; for a whole day’s _tête-à-tête_ between two women can never\n","     end without a quarrel.

Her hopes were answered; Jane had not been gone long before it\n","rained hard. Her sisters were uneasy for her, but her mother was\n","delighted. The rain continued the whole evening without intermission;\n","Jane certainly could not come back.\n","\n","[Paragraph 246] “This was a lucky idea of mine, indeed!” said Mrs. Bennet, more than\n","once, as if the credit of making it rain were all her own. Till the next\n","morning, however, she was not aware of all the felicity of her\n","contrivance. Breakfast was scarcely over when a servant from Netherfield\n","brought the following note for Elizabeth:--\n","\n","[Paragraph 247] /* NIND “My dearest Lizzie, */\n","\n","[Paragraph 248] “I find myself very unwell this morning, which, I suppose, is to be\n","     imputed to my getting wet through yesterday.

They insist also on\n","     my seeing Mr. Jones--therefore do not be alarmed if you should hear\n","     of his having been to me--and, excepting a sore throat and a\n","     headache, there is not much the matter with me.\n","\n","[Paragraph 249] “Yours, etc.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 250] “Well, my dear,” said Mr. Bennet, when Elizabeth had read the note\n","aloud, “if your daughter should have a dangerous fit of illness--if she\n","should die--it would be a comfort to know that it was all in pursuit of\n","Mr. Bingley, and under your orders.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 251] “Oh, I am not at all afraid of her dying. People do not die of little\n","trifling colds. She will be taken good care of. As long as she stays\n","there, it is all very well. I would go and see her if I could have the\n","carriage.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 252] Elizabeth, feeling really anxious, determined to go to her, though the\n","carriage was not to be had: and as she was no horsewoman, walking was\n","her only alternative. She declared her resolution.\n","\n","[Paragraph 253] “How can you be so silly,” cried her mother, “as to think of such a\n","thing, in all this dirt! You will not be fit to be seen when you get\n","there.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 254] “I shall be very fit to see Jane--which is all I want.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 255] “Is this a hint to me, Lizzy,” said her father, “to send for the\n","horses?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 256] “No, indeed. I do not wish to avoid the walk. The distance is nothing,\n","when one has a motive; only three miles. I shall be back by dinner.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 257] “I admire the activity of your benevolence,” observed Mary, “but every\n","impulse of feeling should be guided by reason; and, in my opinion,\n","exertion should always be in proportion to what is required.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 258] “We will go as far as Meryton with you,” said Catherine and Lydia.\n","Elizabeth accepted their company, and the three young ladies set off\n","together.\n","\n","[Paragraph 259] “If we make haste,” said Lydia, as they walked along, “perhaps we may\n","see something of Captain Carter, before he goes.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 260] In Meryton they parted: the two youngest repaired to the lodgings of one\n","of the officers’ wives, and Elizabeth continued her walk alone, crossing\n","field after field at a quick pace, jumping over stiles and springing\n","over puddles, with impatient activity, and finding herself at last\n","within view of the house, with weary ancles, dirty stockings, and a face\n","glowing with the warmth of exercise.\n","\n","[Paragraph 261] She was shown into the breakfast parlour, where all but Jane were\n","assembled, and where her appearance created a great deal of surprise.\n","That she should have walked three miles so early in the day in such\n","dirty weather, and by herself, was almost incredible to Mrs. Hurst and\n","Miss Bingley; and Elizabeth was convinced that they held her in contempt\n","for it. She was received, however, very politely by them; and in their\n","brother’s manners there was something better than politeness--there was\n","good-humour and kindness. Mr. Darcy said very little, and Mr. Hurst\n","nothing at all. The former was divided between admiration of the\n","brilliancy which exercise had given to her complexion and doubt as to\n","the occasion’s justifying her coming so far alone. The latter was\n","thinking only of his breakfast.\n","\n","[Paragraph 262] Her inquiries after her sister were not very favourably answered. Miss\n","Bennet had slept ill, and though up, was very feverish, and not well\n","enough to leave her room. Elizabeth was glad to be taken to her\n","immediately; and Jane, who had only been withheld by the fear of giving\n","alarm or inconvenience, from expressing in her note how much she longed\n","for such a visit, was delighted at her entrance. She was not equal,\n","however, to much conversation; and when Miss Bingley left them together,\n","could attempt little beside expressions of gratitude for the\n","extraordinary kindness she was treated with. Elizabeth silently attended\n","her.\n","\n","[Paragraph 263] When breakfast was over, they were joined by the sisters; and Elizabeth\n","began to like them herself, when she saw how much affection and\n","solicitude they showed for Jane. The apothecary came; and having\n","examined his patient, said, as might be supposed, that she had caught a\n","violent cold, and that they must endeavour to get the better of it;\n","advised her to return to bed, and promised her some draughts. The advice\n","was followed readily, for the feverish symptoms increased, and her head\n","ached acutely. Elizabeth did not quit her room for a moment, nor were\n","the other ladies often absent; the gentlemen being out, they had in fact\n","nothing to do elsewhere.\n","\n","[Paragraph 264] When the clock struck three, Elizabeth felt that she must go, and very\n","unwillingly said so. Miss Bingley offered her the carriage, and she only\n","wanted a little pressing to accept it, when Jane testified such concern\n","at parting with her that Miss Bingley was obliged to convert the offer\n","of the chaise into an invitation to remain at Netherfield for the\n","present. Elizabeth most thankfully consented, and a servant was\n","despatched to Longbourn, to acquaint the family with her stay, and bring\n","back a supply of clothes.\n","\n","[Paragraph 265] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 266] “The Apothecary came”\n","]\n","\n","[Paragraph 267] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 268] “covering a screen”\n","]\n","\n","[Paragraph 269] CHAPTER VIII.\n","\n","[Paragraph 270] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 271] At five o’clock the two ladies retired to dress, and at half-past six\n","Elizabeth was summoned to dinner. To the civil inquiries which then\n","poured in, and amongst which she had the pleasure of distinguishing the\n","much superior solicitude of Mr. Bingley, she could not make a very\n","favourable answer. Jane was by no means better. The sisters, on hearing\n","this, repeated three or four times how much they were grieved, how\n","shocking it was to have a bad cold, and how excessively they disliked\n","being ill themselves; and then thought no more of the matter: and their\n","indifference towards Jane, when not immediately before them, restored\n","Elizabeth to the enjoyment of all her original dislike.\n","\n","[Paragraph 272] Their brother, indeed, was the only one of the party whom she could\n","regard with any complacency. His anxiety for Jane was evident, and his\n","attentions to herself most pleasing; and they prevented her feeling\n","herself so much an intruder as she believed she was considered by the\n","others. She had very little notice from any but him. Miss Bingley was\n","engrossed by Mr. Darcy, her sister scarcely less so; and as for Mr.\n","Hurst, by whom Elizabeth sat, he was an indolent man, who lived only to\n","eat, drink, and play at cards, who, when he found her prefer a plain\n","dish to a ragout, had nothing to say to her.\n","\n","[Paragraph 273] When dinner was over, she returned directly to Jane, and Miss Bingley\n","began abusing her as soon as she was out of the room. Her manners were\n","pronounced to be very bad indeed,--a mixture of pride and impertinence:\n","she had no conversation, no style, no taste, no beauty. Mrs. Hurst\n","thought the same, and added,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 274] “She has nothing, in short, to recommend her, but being an excellent\n","walker. I shall never forget her appearance this morning. She really\n","looked almost wild.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 275] “She did indeed, Louisa. I could hardly keep my countenance. Very\n","nonsensical to come at all! Why must _she_ be scampering about the\n","country, because her sister had a cold? Her hair so untidy, so blowzy!”\n","\n","[Paragraph 276] “Yes, and her petticoat; I hope you saw her petticoat, six inches deep\n","in mud, I am absolutely certain, and the gown which had been let down to\n","hide it not doing its office.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 277] “Your picture may be very exact, Louisa,” said Bingley; “but this was\n","all lost upon me. I thought Miss Elizabeth Bennet looked remarkably well\n","when she came into the room this morning. Her dirty petticoat quite\n","escaped my notice.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 278] “_You_ observed it, Mr. Darcy, I am sure,” said Miss Bingley; “and I am\n","inclined to think that you would not wish to see _your sister_ make such\n","an exhibition.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 279] “Certainly not.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 280] “To walk three miles, or four miles, or five miles, or whatever it is,\n","above her ancles in dirt, and alone, quite alone! what could she mean by\n","it? It seems to me to show an abominable sort of conceited independence,\n","a most country-town indifference to decorum.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 281] “It shows an affection for her sister that is very pleasing,” said\n","Bingley.\n","\n","[Paragraph 282] “I am afraid, Mr. Darcy,” observed Miss Bingley, in a half whisper,\n","“that this adventure has rather affected your admiration of her fine\n","eyes.”\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Index range 735 to 847:\n","\n","[Paragraph 735] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 736] “to assure you in the most animated language”\n","]\n","\n","[Paragraph 737] CHAPTER XIX.\n","\n","[Paragraph 738] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 739] The next day opened a new scene at Longbourn. Mr. Collins made his\n","declaration in form. Having resolved to do it without loss of time, as\n","his leave of absence extended only to the following Saturday, and having\n","no feelings of diffidence to make it distressing to himself even at the\n","moment, he set about it in a very orderly manner, with all the\n","observances which he supposed a regular part of the business. On finding\n","Mrs. Bennet, Elizabeth, and one of the younger girls together, soon\n","after breakfast, he addressed the mother in these words,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 740] “May I hope, madam, for your interest with your fair daughter Elizabeth,\n","when I solicit for the honour of a private audience with her in the\n","course of this morning?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 741] Before Elizabeth had time for anything but a blush of surprise, Mrs.\n","Bennet instantly answered,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 742] “Oh dear! Yes, certainly. I am sure Lizzy will be very happy--I am sure\n","she can have no objection. Come, Kitty, I want you upstairs.” And\n","gathering her work together, she was hastening away, when Elizabeth\n","called out,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 743] “Dear ma’am, do not go.

Mrs. Bennet and Kitty walked off, and as\n","soon as they were gone, Mr. Collins began,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 746] “Believe me, my dear Miss Elizabeth, that your modesty, so far from\n","doing you any disservice, rather adds to your other perfections.

But before I am run away with by my feelings on this\n","subject, perhaps it will be advisable for me to state my reasons for\n","marrying--and, moreover, for coming into Hertfordshire with the design\n","of selecting a wife, as I certainly did.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 747] The idea of Mr. Collins, with all his solemn composure, being run away\n","with by his feelings, made Elizabeth so near laughing that she could not\n","use the short pause he allowed in any attempt to stop him farther, and\n","he continued,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 748] “My reasons for marrying are, first, that I think it a right thing for\n","every clergyman in easy circumstances (like myself) to set the example\n","of matrimony in his parish; secondly, that I am convinced it will add\n","very greatly to my happiness; and, thirdly, which perhaps I ought to\n","have mentioned earlier, that it is the particular advice and\n","recommendation of the very noble lady whom I have the honour of calling\n","patroness. Twice has she condescended to give me her opinion (unasked\n","too!) on this subject; and it was but the very Saturday night before I\n","left Hunsford,--between our pools at quadrille, while Mrs. Jenkinson was\n","arranging Miss De Bourgh’s footstool,--that she said, ‘Mr. Collins, you\n","must marry. A clergyman like you must marry. Choose properly, choose a\n","gentlewoman for _my_ sake, and for your _own_; let her be an active,\n","useful sort of person, not brought up high, but able to make a small\n","income go a good way. This is my advice. Find such a woman as soon as\n","you can, bring her to Hunsford, and I will visit her.’ Allow me, by the\n","way, to observe, my fair cousin, that I do not reckon the notice and\n","kindness of Lady Catherine de Bourgh as among the least of the\n","advantages in my power to offer. You will find her manners beyond\n","anything I can describe; and your wit and vivacity, I think, must be\n","acceptable to her, especially when tempered with the silence and respect\n","which her rank will inevitably excite. Thus much for my general\n","intention in favour of matrimony; it remains to be told why my views\n","were directed to Longbourn instead of my own neighbourhood, where I\n","assure you there are many amiable young women. But the fact is, that\n","being, as I am, to inherit this estate after the death of your honoured\n","father (who, however, may live many years longer), I could not satisfy\n","myself without resolving to choose a wife from among his daughters, that\n","the loss to them might be as little as possible when the melancholy\n","event takes place--which, however, as I have already said, may not be\n","for several years. This has been my motive, my fair cousin, and I\n","flatter myself it will not sink me in your esteem. And now nothing\n","remains for me but to assure you in the most animated language of the\n","violence of my affection. To fortune I am perfectly indifferent, and\n","shall make no demand of that nature on your father, since I am well\n","aware that it could not be complied with; and that one thousand pounds\n","in the 4 per cents., which will not be yours till after your mother’s\n","decease, is all that you may ever be entitled to. On that head,\n","therefore, I shall be uniformly silent: and you may assure yourself that\n","no ungenerous reproach shall ever pass my lips when we are married.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 749] It was absolutely necessary to interrupt him now.\n","\n","[Paragraph 750] “You are too hasty, sir,” she cried. “You forget that I have made no\n","answer. Let me do it without further loss of time. Accept my thanks for\n","the compliment you are paying me. I am very sensible of the honour of\n","your proposals, but it is impossible for me to do otherwise than decline\n","them.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 751] “I am not now to learn,” replied Mr. Collins, with a formal wave of the\n","hand, “that it is usual with young ladies to reject the addresses of the\n","man whom they secretly mean to accept, when he first applies for their\n","favour; and that sometimes the refusal is repeated a second or even a\n","third time. I am, therefore, by no means discouraged by what you have\n","just said, and shall hope to lead you to the altar ere long.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 752] “Upon my word, sir,” cried Elizabeth, “your hope is rather an\n","extraordinary one after my declaration. I do assure you that I am not\n","one of those young ladies (if such young ladies there are) who are so\n","daring as to risk their happiness on the chance of being asked a second\n","time. I am perfectly serious in my refusal. You could not make _me_\n","happy, and I am convinced that I am the last woman in the world who\n","would make _you_ so. Nay, were your friend Lady Catherine to know me, I\n","am persuaded she would find me in every respect ill qualified for the\n","situation.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 753] “Were it certain that Lady Catherine would think so,” said Mr. Collins,\n","very gravely--“but I cannot imagine that her Ladyship would at all\n","disapprove of you. And you may be certain that when I have the honour of\n","seeing her again I shall speak in the highest terms of your modesty,\n","economy, and other amiable qualifications.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 754] “Indeed, Mr. Collins, all praise of me will be unnecessary. You must\n","give me leave to judge for myself, and pay me the compliment of\n","believing what I say. I wish you very happy and very rich, and by\n","refusing your hand, do all in my power to prevent your being otherwise.\n","In making me the offer, you must have satisfied the delicacy of your\n","feelings with regard to my family, and may take possession of Longbourn\n","estate whenever it falls, without any self-reproach. This matter may be\n","considered, therefore, as finally settled.” And rising as she thus\n","spoke, she would have quitted the room, had not Mr. Collins thus\n","addressed her,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 755] “When I do myself the honour of speaking to you next on the subject, I\n","shall hope to receive a more favourable answer than you have now given\n","me; though I am far from accusing you of cruelty at present, because I\n","know it to be the established custom of your sex to reject a man on the\n","first application, and, perhaps, you have even now said as much to\n","encourage my suit as would be consistent with the true delicacy of the\n","female character.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 756] “Really, Mr. Collins,” cried Elizabeth, with some warmth, “you puzzle me\n","exceedingly. If what I have hitherto said can appear to you in the form\n","of encouragement, I know not how to express my refusal in such a way as\n","may convince you of its being one.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 757] “You must give me leave to flatter myself, my dear cousin, that your\n","refusal of my addresses are merely words of course. My reasons for\n","believing it are briefly these:--It does not appear to me that my hand\n","is unworthy your acceptance, or that the establishment I can offer would\n","be any other than highly desirable. My situation in life, my connections\n","with the family of De Bourgh, and my relationship to your own, are\n","circumstances highly in my favour; and you should take it into further\n","consideration that, in spite of your manifold attractions, it is by no\n","means certain that another offer of marriage may ever be made you. Your\n","portion is unhappily so small, that it will in all likelihood undo the\n","effects of your loveliness and amiable qualifications. As I must,\n","therefore, conclude that you are not serious in your rejection of me, I\n","shall choose to attribute it to your wish of increasing my love by\n","suspense, according to the usual practice of elegant females.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 758] “I do assure you, sir, that I have no pretensions whatever to that kind\n","of elegance which consists in tormenting a respectable man. I would\n","rather be paid the compliment of being believed sincere. I thank you\n","again and again for the honour you have done me in your proposals, but\n","to accept them is absolutely impossible. My feelings in every respect\n","forbid it. Can I speak plainer? Do not consider me now as an elegant\n","female intending to plague you, but as a rational creature speaking the\n","truth from her heart.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 759] “You are uniformly charming!” cried he, with an air of awkward\n","gallantry; “and I am persuaded that, when sanctioned by the express\n","authority of both your excellent parents, my proposals will not fail of\n","being acceptable.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 760] To such perseverance in wilful self-deception Elizabeth would make no\n","reply, and immediately and in silence withdrew; determined, that if he\n","persisted in considering her repeated refusals as flattering\n","encouragement, to apply to her father, whose negative might be uttered\n","in such a manner as must be decisive, and whose behaviour at least could\n","not be mistaken for the affectation and coquetry of an elegant female.\n","\n","[Paragraph 761] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 762] CHAPTER XX.\n","\n","[Paragraph 763] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 764] Mr. Collins was not left long to the silent contemplation of his\n","successful love; for Mrs. Bennet, having dawdled about in the vestibule\n","to watch for the end of the conference, no sooner saw Elizabeth open the\n","door and with quick step pass her towards the staircase, than she\n","entered the breakfast-room, and congratulated both him and herself in\n","warm terms on the happy prospect of their nearer connection. Mr. Collins\n","received and returned these felicitations with equal pleasure, and then\n","proceeded to relate the particulars of their interview, with the result\n","of which he trusted he had every reason to be satisfied, since the\n","refusal which his cousin had steadfastly given him would naturally flow\n","from her bashful modesty and the genuine delicacy of her character.\n","\n","[Paragraph 765] This information, however, startled Mrs. Bennet: she would have been\n","glad to be equally satisfied that her daughter had meant to encourage\n","him by protesting against his proposals, but she dared not believe it,\n","and could not help saying so.\n","\n","[Paragraph 766] “But depend upon it, Mr. Collins,” she added, “that Lizzy shall be\n","brought to reason. I will speak to her about it myself directly. She is\n","a very headstrong, foolish girl, and does not know her own interest; but\n","I will _make_ her know it.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 767] “Pardon me for interrupting you, madam,” cried Mr. Collins; “but if she\n","is really headstrong and foolish, I know not whether she would\n","altogether be a very desirable wife to a man in my situation, who\n","naturally looks for happiness in the marriage state. If, therefore, she\n","actually persists in rejecting my suit, perhaps it were better not to\n","force her into accepting me, because, if liable to such defects of\n","temper, she could not contribute much to my felicity.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 768] “Sir, you quite misunderstand me,” said Mrs. Bennet, alarmed. “Lizzy is\n","only headstrong in such matters as these. In everything else she is as\n","good-natured a girl as ever lived. I will go directly to Mr. Bennet, and\n","we shall very soon settle it with her, I am sure.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 769] She would not give him time to reply, but hurrying instantly to her\n","husband, called out, as she entered the library,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 770] “Oh, Mr. Bennet, you are wanted immediately; we are all in an uproar.\n","You must come and make Lizzy marry Mr. Collins, for she vows she will\n","not have him; and if you do not make haste he will change his mind and\n","not have _her_.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 771] Mr. Bennet raised his eyes from his book as she entered, and fixed them\n","on her face with a calm unconcern, which was not in the least altered by\n","her communication.\n","\n","[Paragraph 772] “I have not the pleasure of understanding you,” said he, when she had\n","finished her speech. “Of what are you talking?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 773] “Of Mr. Collins and Lizzy. Lizzy declares she will not have Mr. Collins,\n","and Mr. Collins begins to say that he will not have Lizzy.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 774] “And what am I to do on the occasion? It seems a hopeless business.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 775] “Speak to Lizzy about it yourself. Tell her that you insist upon her\n","marrying him.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 776] “Let her be called down. She shall hear my opinion.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 777] Mrs. Bennet rang the bell, and Miss Elizabeth was summoned to the\n","library.\n","\n","[Paragraph 778] “Come here, child,” cried her father as she appeared. “I have sent for\n","you on an affair of importance. I understand that Mr. Collins has made\n","you an offer of marriage. Is it true?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 779] Elizabeth replied that it was.\n","\n","[Paragraph 780] “Very well--and this offer of marriage you have refused?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 781] “I have, sir.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 782] “Very well. We now come to the point. Your mother insists upon your\n","accepting it. Is it not so, Mrs. Bennet?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 783] “Yes, or I will never see her again.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 784] “An unhappy alternative is before you, Elizabeth. From this day you must\n","be a stranger to one of your parents. Your mother will never see you\n","again if you do _not_ marry Mr. Collins, and I will never see you again\n","if you _do_.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 785] Elizabeth could not but smile at such a conclusion of such a beginning;\n","but Mrs. Bennet, who had persuaded herself that her husband regarded the\n","affair as she wished, was excessively disappointed.\n","\n","[Paragraph 786] “What do you mean, Mr. Bennet, by talking in this way? You promised me\n","to _insist_ upon her marrying him.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 787] “My dear,” replied her husband, “I have two small favours to request.\n","First, that you will allow me the free use of my understanding on the\n","present occasion; and, secondly, of my room. I shall be glad to have the\n","library to myself as soon as may be.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 788] Not yet, however, in spite of her disappointment in her husband, did\n","Mrs. Bennet give up the point. She talked to Elizabeth again and again;\n","coaxed and threatened her by turns. She endeavoured to secure Jane in\n","her interest, but Jane, with all possible mildness, declined\n","interfering; and Elizabeth, sometimes with real earnestness, and\n","sometimes with playful gaiety, replied to her attacks. Though her manner\n","varied, however, her determination never did.\n","\n","[Paragraph 789] Mr. Collins, meanwhile, was meditating in solitude on what had passed.\n","He thought too well of himself to comprehend on what motive his cousin\n","could refuse him; and though his pride was hurt, he suffered in no other\n","way. His regard for her was quite imaginary; and the possibility of her\n","deserving her mother’s reproach prevented his feeling any regret.\n","\n","[Paragraph 790] While the family were in this confusion, Charlotte Lucas came to spend\n","the day with them. She was met in the vestibule by Lydia, who, flying to\n","her, cried in a half whisper, “I am glad you are come, for there is such\n","fun here! What do you think has happened this morning? Mr. Collins has\n","made an offer to Lizzy, and she will not have him.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 791] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 792] “they entered the breakfast room”\n","]\n","\n","[Paragraph 793] Charlotte had hardly time to answer before they were joined by Kitty,\n","who came to tell the same news; and no sooner had they entered the\n","breakfast-room, where Mrs. Bennet was alone, than she likewise began on\n","the subject, calling on Miss Lucas for her compassion, and entreating\n","her to persuade her friend Lizzy to comply with the wishes of her\n","family. “Pray do, my dear Miss Lucas,” she added, in a melancholy tone;\n","“for nobody is on my side, nobody takes part with me; I am cruelly used,\n","nobody feels for my poor nerves.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 794] Charlotte’s reply was spared by the entrance of Jane and Elizabeth.\n","\n","[Paragraph 795] “Ay, there she comes,” continued Mrs. Bennet, “looking as unconcerned as\n","may be, and caring no more for us than if we were at York, provided she\n","can have her own way. But I tell you what, Miss Lizzy, if you take it\n","into your head to go on refusing every offer of marriage in this way,\n","you will never get a husband at all--and I am sure I do not know who is\n","to maintain you when your father is dead. _I_ shall not be able to keep\n","you--and so I warn you. I have done with you from this very day. I told\n","you in the library, you know, that I should never speak to you again,\n","and you will find me as good as my word. I have no pleasure in talking\n","to undutiful children. Not that I have much pleasure, indeed, in talking\n","to anybody. People who suffer as I do from nervous complaints can have\n","no great inclination for talking. Nobody can tell what I suffer! But it\n","is always so. Those who do not complain are never pitied.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 796] Her daughters listened in silence to this effusion, sensible that any\n","attempt to reason with or soothe her would only increase the irritation.\n","She talked on, therefore, without interruption from any of them till\n","they were joined by Mr. Collins, who entered with an air more stately\n","than usual, and on perceiving whom, she said to the girls,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 797] “Now, I do insist upon it, that you, all of you, hold your tongues, and\n","let Mr. Collins and me have a little conversation together.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 798] Elizabeth passed quietly out of the room, Jane and Kitty followed, but\n","Lydia stood her ground, determined to hear all she could; and Charlotte,\n","detained first by the civility of Mr. Collins, whose inquiries after\n","herself and all her family were very minute, and then by a little\n","curiosity, satisfied herself with walking to the window and pretending\n","not to hear. In a doleful voice Mrs. Bennet thus began the projected\n","conversation:--\n","\n","[Paragraph 799] “Oh, Mr. Collins!”\n","\n","[Paragraph 800] “My dear madam,” replied he, “let us be for ever silent on this point.\n","Far be it from me,” he presently continued, in a voice that marked his\n","displeasure, “to resent the behaviour of your daughter. Resignation to\n","inevitable evils is the duty of us all: the peculiar duty of a young man\n","who has been so fortunate as I have been, in early preferment; and, I\n","trust, I am resigned. Perhaps not the less so from feeling a doubt of my\n","positive happiness had my fair cousin honoured me with her hand; for I\n","have often observed, that resignation is never so perfect as when the\n","blessing denied begins to lose somewhat of its value in our estimation.\n","You will not, I hope, consider me as showing any disrespect to your\n","family, my dear madam, by thus withdrawing my pretensions to your\n","daughter’s favour, without having paid yourself and Mr. Bennet the\n","compliment of requesting you to interpose your authority in my behalf.\n","My conduct may, I fear, be objectionable in having accepted my\n","dismission from your daughter’s lips instead of your own; but we are all\n","liable to error. I have certainly meant well through the whole affair.\n","My object has been to secure an amiable companion for myself, with due\n","consideration for the advantage of all your family; and if my _manner_\n","has been at all reprehensible, I here beg leave to apologize.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 801] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 802] CHAPTER XXI.\n","\n","[Paragraph 803] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 804] The discussion of Mr. Collins’s offer was now nearly at an end, and\n","Elizabeth had only to suffer from the uncomfortable feelings necessarily\n","attending it, and occasionally from some peevish allusion of her mother.\n","As for the gentleman himself, _his_ feelings were chiefly expressed, not\n","by embarrassment or dejection, or by trying to avoid her, but by\n","stiffness of manner and resentful silence. He scarcely ever spoke to\n","her; and the assiduous attentions which he had been so sensible of\n","himself were transferred for the rest of the day to Miss Lucas, whose\n","civility in listening to him was a seasonable relief to them all, and\n","especially to her friend.\n","\n","[Paragraph 805] The morrow produced no abatement of Mrs. Bennet’s ill humour or ill\n","health. Mr. Collins was also in the same state of angry pride. Elizabeth\n","had hoped that his resentment might shorten his visit, but his plan did\n","not appear in the least affected by it. He was always to have gone on\n","Saturday, and to Saturday he still meant to stay.\n","\n","[Paragraph 806] After breakfast, the girls walked to Meryton, to inquire if Mr. Wickham\n","were returned, and to lament over his absence from the Netherfield ball.\n","He joined them on their entering the town, and attended them to their\n","aunt’s, where his regret and vexation and the concern of everybody were\n","well talked over. To Elizabeth, however, he voluntarily acknowledged\n","that the necessity of his absence _had_ been self-imposed.\n","\n","[Paragraph 807] “I found,” said he, “as the time drew near, that I had better not meet\n","Mr. Darcy;--that to be in the same room, the same party with him for so\n","many hours together, might be more than I could bear, and that scenes\n","might arise unpleasant to more than myself.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 808] She highly approved his forbearance; and they had leisure for a full\n","discussion of it, and for all the commendations which they civilly\n","bestowed on each other, as Wickham and another officer walked back with\n","them to Longbourn, and during the walk he particularly attended to her.\n","His accompanying them was a double advantage: she felt all the\n","compliment it offered to herself; and it was most acceptable as an\n","occasion of introducing him to her father and mother.\n","\n","[Paragraph 809] [Illustration: “Walked back with them”\n","\n","[Paragraph 810] [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n","\n","[Paragraph 811] Soon after their return, a letter was delivered to Miss Bennet; it came\n","from Netherfield, and was opened immediately. The envelope contained a\n","sheet of elegant, little, hot-pressed paper, well covered with a lady’s\n","fair, flowing hand; and Elizabeth saw her sister’s countenance change as\n","she read it, and saw her dwelling intently on some particular passages.\n","Jane recollected herself soon; and putting the letter away, tried to\n","join, with her usual cheerfulness, in the general conversation: but\n","Elizabeth felt an anxiety on the subject which drew off her attention\n","even from Wickham; and no sooner had he and his companion taken leave,\n","than a glance from Jane invited her to follow her upstairs. When they\n","had gained their own room, Jane, taking out her letter, said, “This is\n","from Caroline Bingley: what it contains has surprised me a good deal.\n","The whole party have left Netherfield by this time, and are on their way\n","to town; and without any intention of coming back again. You shall hear\n","what she says.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 812] She then read the first sentence aloud, which comprised the information\n","of their having just resolved to follow their brother to town directly,\n","and of their meaning to dine that day in Grosvenor Street, where Mr.\n","Hurst had a house. The next was in these words:--“‘I do not pretend to\n","regret anything I shall leave in Hertfordshire except your society, my\n","dearest friend; but we will hope, at some future period, to enjoy many\n","returns of that delightful intercourse we have known, and in the\n","meanwhile may lessen the pain of separation by a very frequent and most\n","unreserved correspondence. I depend on you for that.’” To these\n","high-flown expressions Elizabeth listened with all the insensibility of\n","distrust; and though the suddenness of their removal surprised her, she\n","saw nothing in it really to lament: it was not to be supposed that their\n","absence from Netherfield would prevent Mr. Bingley’s being there; and as\n","to the loss of their society, she was persuaded that Jane must soon\n","cease to regard it in the enjoyment of his.\n","\n","[Paragraph 813] “It is unlucky,” said she, after a short pause, “that you should not be\n","able to see your friends before they leave the country. But may we not\n","hope that the period of future happiness, to which Miss Bingley looks\n","forward, may arrive earlier than she is aware, and that the delightful\n","intercourse you have known as friends will be renewed with yet greater\n","satisfaction as sisters? Mr. Bingley will not be detained in London by\n","them.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 814] “Caroline decidedly says that none of the party will return into\n","Hertfordshire this winter. I will read it to you.\n","\n","[Paragraph 815] “‘When my brother left us yesterday, he imagined that the business which\n","took him to London might be concluded in three or four days; but as we\n","are certain it cannot be so, and at the same time convinced that when\n","Charles gets to town he will be in no hurry to leave it again, we have\n","determined on following him thither, that he may not be obliged to spend\n","his vacant hours in a comfortless hotel. Many of my acquaintance are\n","already there for the winter: I wish I could hear that you, my dearest\n","friend, had any intention of making one in the crowd, but of that I\n","despair. I sincerely hope your Christmas in Hertfordshire may abound in\n","the gaieties which that season generally brings, and that your beaux\n","will be so numerous as to prevent your feeling the loss of the three of\n","whom we shall deprive you.’\n","\n","[Paragraph 816] “It is evident by this,” added Jane, “that he comes back no more this\n","winter.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 817] “It is only evident that Miss Bingley does not mean he _should_.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 818] “Why will you think so? It must be his own doing; he is his own master.\n","But you do not know _all_. I _will_ read you the passage which\n","particularly hurts me. I will have no reserves from _you_. ‘Mr. Darcy is\n","impatient to see his sister; and to confess the truth, _we_ are scarcely\n","less eager to meet her again. I really do not think Georgiana Darcy has\n","her equal for beauty, elegance, and accomplishments; and the affection\n","she inspires in Louisa and myself is heightened into something still\n","more interesting from the hope we dare to entertain of her being\n","hereafter our sister. I do not know whether I ever before mentioned to\n","you my feelings on this subject, but I will not leave the country\n","without confiding them, and I trust you will not esteem them\n","unreasonable. My brother admires her greatly already; he will have\n","frequent opportunity now of seeing her on the most intimate footing; her\n","relations all wish the connection as much as his own; and a sister’s\n","partiality is not misleading me, I think, when I call Charles most\n","capable of engaging any woman’s heart. With all these circumstances to\n","favour an attachment, and nothing to prevent it, am I wrong, my dearest\n","Jane, in indulging the hope of an event which will secure the happiness\n","of so many?’ What think you of _this_ sentence, my dear Lizzy?” said\n","Jane, as she finished it. “Is it not clear enough? Does it not expressly\n","declare that Caroline neither expects nor wishes me to be her sister;\n","that she is perfectly convinced of her brother’s indifference; and that\n","if she suspects the nature of my feelings for him she means (most\n","kindly!) to put me on my guard. Can there be any other opinion on the\n","subject?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 819] “Yes, there can; for mine is totally different. Will you hear it?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 820] “Most willingly.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 821] “You shall have it in a few words. Miss Bingley sees that her brother is\n","in love with you and wants him to marry Miss Darcy. She follows him to\n","town in the hope of keeping him there, and tries to persuade you that he\n","does not care about you.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 822] Jane shook her head.\n","\n","[Paragraph 823] “Indeed, Jane, you ought to believe me. No one who has ever seen you\n","together can doubt his affection; Miss Bingley, I am sure, cannot: she\n","is not such a simpleton. Could she have seen half as much love in Mr.\n","Darcy for herself, she would have ordered her wedding clothes. But the\n","case is this:--we are not rich enough or grand enough for them; and she\n","is the more anxious to get Miss Darcy for her brother, from the notion\n","that when there has been _one_ inter-marriage, she may have less trouble\n","in achieving a second; in which there is certainly some ingenuity, and I\n","dare say it would succeed if Miss de Bourgh were out of the way. But, my\n","dearest Jane, you cannot seriously imagine that, because Miss Bingley\n","tells you her brother greatly admires Miss Darcy, he is in the smallest\n","degree less sensible of _your_ merit than when he took leave of you on\n","Tuesday; or that it will be in her power to persuade him that, instead\n","of being in love with you, he is very much in love with her friend.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 824] “If we thought alike of Miss Bingley,” replied Jane, “your\n","representation of all this might make me quite easy. But I know the\n","foundation is unjust. Caroline is incapable of wilfully deceiving\n","anyone; and all that I can hope in this case is, that she is deceived\n","herself.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 825] “That is right. You could not have started a more happy idea, since you\n","will not take comfort in mine: believe her to be deceived, by all means.\n","You have now done your duty by her, and must fret no longer.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 826] “But, my dear sister, can I be happy, even supposing the best, in\n","accepting a man whose sisters and friends are all wishing him to marry\n","elsewhere?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 827] “You must decide for yourself,” said Elizabeth; “and if, upon mature\n","deliberation, you find that the misery of disobliging his two sisters is\n","more than equivalent to the happiness of being his wife, I advise you,\n","by all means, to refuse him.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 828] “How can you talk so?” said Jane, faintly smiling; “you must know, that,\n","though I should be exceedingly grieved at their disapprobation, I could\n","not hesitate.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 829] “I did not think you would; and that being the case, I cannot consider\n","your situation with much compassion.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 830] “But if he returns no more this winter, my choice will never be\n","required. A thousand things may arise in six months.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 831] The idea of his returning no more Elizabeth treated with the utmost\n","contempt. It appeared to her merely the suggestion of Caroline’s\n","interested wishes; and she could not for a moment suppose that those\n","wishes, however openly or artfully spoken, could influence a young man\n","so totally independent of everyone.\n","\n","[Paragraph 832] She represented to her sister, as forcibly as possible, what she felt on\n","the subject, and had soon the pleasure of seeing its happy effect.\n","Jane’s temper was not desponding; and she was gradually led to hope,\n","though the diffidence of affection sometimes overcame the hope, that\n","Bingley would return to Netherfield, and answer every wish of her heart.\n","\n","[Paragraph 833] They agreed that Mrs. Bennet should only hear of the departure of the\n","family, without being alarmed on the score of the gentleman’s conduct;\n","but even this partial communication gave her a great deal of concern,\n","and she bewailed it as exceedingly unlucky that the ladies should happen\n","to go away just as they were all getting so intimate together. After\n","lamenting it, however, at some length, she had the consolation of\n","thinking that Mr. Bingley would be soon down again, and soon dining at\n","Longbourn; and the conclusion of all was the comfortable declaration,\n","that, though he had been invited only to a family dinner, she would take\n","care to have two full courses.\n","\n","[Paragraph 834] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 835] CHAPTER XXII.\n","\n","[Paragraph 836] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 837] The Bennets were engaged to dine with the Lucases; and again, during the\n","chief of the day, was Miss Lucas so kind as to listen to Mr. Collins.\n","Elizabeth took an opportunity of thanking her. “It keeps him in good\n","humour,” said she, “and I am more obliged to you than I can express.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 838] Charlotte assured her friend of her satisfaction in being useful, and\n","that it amply repaid her for the little sacrifice of her time. This was\n","very amiable; but Charlotte’s kindness extended farther than Elizabeth\n","had any conception of:--its object was nothing less than to secure her\n","from any return of Mr. Collins’s addresses, by engaging them towards\n","herself. Such was Miss Lucas’s scheme; and appearances were so\n","favourable, that when they parted at night, she would have felt almost\n","sure of success if he had not been to leave Hertfordshire so very soon.\n","But here she did injustice to the fire and independence of his\n","character; for it led him to escape out of Longbourn House the next\n","morning with admirable slyness, and hasten to Lucas Lodge to throw\n","himself at her feet. He was anxious to avoid the notice of his cousins,\n","from a conviction that, if they saw him depart, they could not fail to\n","conjecture his design, and he was not willing to have the attempt known\n","till its success could be known likewise; for, though feeling almost\n","secure, and with reason, for Charlotte had been tolerably encouraging,\n","he was comparatively diffident since the adventure of Wednesday. His\n","reception, however, was of the most flattering kind. Miss Lucas\n","perceived him from an upper window as he walked towards the house, and\n","instantly set out to meet him accidentally in the lane. But little had\n","she dared to hope that so much love and eloquence awaited her there.\n","\n","[Paragraph 839] In as short a time as Mr. Collins’s long speeches would allow,\n","everything was settled between them to the satisfaction of both; and as\n","they entered the house, he earnestly entreated her to name the day that\n","was to make him the happiest of men; and though such a solicitation must\n","be waived for the present, the lady felt no inclination to trifle with\n","his happiness. The stupidity with which he was favoured by nature must\n","guard his courtship from any charm that could make a woman wish for its\n","continuance; and Miss Lucas, who accepted him solely from the pure and\n","disinterested desire of an establishment, cared not how soon that\n","establishment were gained.\n","\n","[Paragraph 840] Sir William and Lady Lucas were speedily applied to for their consent;\n","and it was bestowed with a most joyful alacrity. Mr. Collins’s present\n","circumstances made it a most eligible match for their daughter, to whom\n","they could give little fortune; and his prospects of future wealth were\n","exceedingly fair. Lady Lucas began directly to calculate, with more\n","interest than the matter had ever\n","\n","[Paragraph 841] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 842] “So much love and eloquence”\n","\n","[Paragraph 843] [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n","\n","[Paragraph 844] excited before, how many years longer Mr. Bennet was likely to live; and\n","Sir William gave it as his decided opinion, that whenever Mr. Collins\n","should be in possession of the Longbourn estate, it would be highly\n","expedient that both he and his wife should make their appearance at St.\n","James’s. The whole family in short were properly overjoyed on the\n","occasion. The younger girls formed hopes of _coming out_ a year or two\n","sooner than they might otherwise have done; and the boys were relieved\n","from their apprehension of Charlotte’s dying an old maid. Charlotte\n","herself was tolerably composed. She had gained her point, and had time\n","to consider of it. Her reflections were in general satisfactory. Mr.\n","Collins, to be sure, was neither sensible nor agreeable: his society was\n","irksome, and his attachment to her must be imaginary. But still he would\n","be her husband. Without thinking highly either of men or of matrimony,\n","marriage had always been her object: it was the only honourable\n","provision for well-educated young women of small fortune, and, however\n","uncertain of giving happiness, must be their pleasantest preservative\n","from want. This preservative she had now obtained; and at the age of\n","twenty-seven, without having ever been handsome, she felt all the good\n","luck of it. The least agreeable circumstance in the business was the\n","surprise it must occasion to Elizabeth Bennet, whose friendship she\n","valued beyond that of any other person. Elizabeth would wonder, and\n","probably would blame her; and though her resolution was not to be\n","shaken, her feelings must be hurt by such a disapprobation. She resolved\n","to give her the information herself; and therefore charged Mr. Collins,\n","when he returned to Longbourn to dinner, to drop no hint of what had\n","passed before any of the family. A promise of secrecy was of course very\n","dutifully given, but it could not be kept without difficulty; for the\n","curiosity excited by his long absence burst forth in such very direct\n","questions on his return, as required some ingenuity to evade, and he was\n","at the same time exercising great self-denial, for he was longing to\n","publish his prosperous love.\n","\n","[Paragraph 845] As he was to begin his journey too early on the morrow to see any of\n","the family, the ceremony of leave-taking was performed when the ladies\n","moved for the night; and Mrs. Bennet, with great politeness and\n","cordiality, said how happy they should be to see him at Longbourn again,\n","whenever his other engagements might allow him to visit them.\n","\n","[Paragraph 846] “My dear madam,” he replied, “this invitation is particularly\n","gratifying, because it is what I have been hoping to receive; and you\n","may be very certain that I shall avail myself of it as soon as\n","possible.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 847] They were all astonished; and Mr. Bennet, who could by no means wish for\n","so speedy a return, immediately said,--\n","\n","==================================================\n","\n","Index range 1187 to 1299:\n","\n","[Paragraph 1187] “Do you certainly leave Kent on Saturday?” said she.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1188] “Yes--if Darcy does not put it off again. But I am at his disposal. He\n","arranges the business just as he pleases.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1189] “And if not able to please himself in the arrangement, he has at least\n","great pleasure in the power of choice. I do not know anybody who seems\n","more to enjoy the power of doing what he likes than Mr. Darcy.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1190] “He likes to have his own way very well,” replied Colonel Fitzwilliam.\n","“But so we all do. It is only that he has better means of having it than\n","many others, because he is rich, and many others are poor. I speak\n","feelingly. A younger son, you know, must be inured to self-denial and\n","dependence.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1191] “In my opinion, the younger son of an earl can know very little of\n","either. Now, seriously, what have you ever known of self-denial and\n","dependence? When have you been prevented by want of money from going\n","wherever you chose or procuring anything you had a fancy for?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1192] “These are home questions--and perhaps I cannot say that I have\n","experienced many hardships of that nature. But in matters of greater\n","weight, I may suffer from the want of money. Younger sons cannot marry\n","where they like.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1193] “Unless where they like women of fortune, which I think they very often\n","do.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1194] “Our habits of expense make us too dependent, and there are not many in\n","my rank of life who can afford to marry without some attention to\n","money.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1195] “Is this,” thought Elizabeth, “meant for me?” and she coloured at the\n","idea; but, recovering herself, said in a lively tone, “And pray, what is\n","the usual price of an earl’s younger son? Unless the elder brother is\n","very sickly, I suppose you would not ask above fifty thousand pounds.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1196] He answered her in the same style, and the subject dropped. To interrupt\n","a silence which might make him fancy her affected with what had passed,\n","she soon afterwards said,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1197] “I imagine your cousin brought you down with him chiefly for the sake of\n","having somebody at his disposal. I wonder he does not marry, to secure a\n","lasting convenience of that kind. But, perhaps, his sister does as well\n","for the present; and, as she is under his sole care, he may do what he\n","likes with her.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1198] “No,” said Colonel Fitzwilliam, “that is an advantage which he must\n","divide with me. I am joined with him in the guardianship of Miss Darcy.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1199] “Are you, indeed? And pray what sort of a guardian do you make? Does\n","your charge give you much trouble? Young ladies of her age are sometimes\n","a little difficult to manage; and if she has the true Darcy spirit, she\n","may like to have her own way.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1200] As she spoke, she observed him looking at her earnestly; and the manner\n","in which he immediately asked her why she supposed Miss Darcy likely to\n","give them any uneasiness, convinced her that she had somehow or other\n","got pretty near the truth. She directly replied,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1201] “You need not be frightened. I never heard any harm of her; and I dare\n","say she is one of the most tractable creatures in the world. She is a\n","very great favourite with some ladies of my acquaintance, Mrs. Hurst and\n","Miss Bingley. I think I have heard you say that you know them.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1202] “I know them a little. Their brother is a pleasant, gentlemanlike\n","man--he is a great friend of Darcy’s.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1203] “Oh yes,” said Elizabeth drily--“Mr. Darcy is uncommonly kind to Mr.\n","Bingley, and takes a prodigious deal of care of him.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1204] “Care of him! Yes, I really believe Darcy _does_ take care of him in\n","those points where he most wants care. From something that he told me\n","in our journey hither, I have reason to think Bingley very much indebted\n","to him. But I ought to beg his pardon, for I have no right to suppose\n","that Bingley was the person meant. It was all conjecture.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1205] “What is it you mean?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1206] “It is a circumstance which Darcy of course could not wish to be\n","generally known, because if it were to get round to the lady’s family it\n","would be an unpleasant thing.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1207] “You may depend upon my not mentioning it.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1208] “And remember that I have not much reason for supposing it to be\n","Bingley. What he told me was merely this: that he congratulated himself\n","on having lately saved a friend from the inconveniences of a most\n","imprudent marriage, but without mentioning names or any other\n","particulars; and I only suspected it to be Bingley from believing him\n","the kind of young man to get into a scrape of that sort, and from\n","knowing them to have been together the whole of last summer.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1209] “Did Mr. Darcy give you his reasons for this interference?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1210] “I understood that there were some very strong objections against the\n","lady.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1211] “And what arts did he use to separate them?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1212] “He did not talk to me of his own arts,” said Fitzwilliam, smiling. “He\n","only told me what I have now told you.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1213] Elizabeth made no answer, and walked on, her heart swelling with\n","indignation. After watching her a little, Fitzwilliam asked her why she\n","was so thoughtful.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1214] “I am thinking of what you have been telling me,” said she. “Your\n","cousin’s conduct does not suit my feelings. Why was he to be the\n","judge?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1215] “You are rather disposed to call his interference officious?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1216] “I do not see what right Mr. Darcy had to decide on the propriety of his\n","friend’s inclination; or why, upon his own judgment alone, he was to\n","determine and direct in what manner that friend was to be happy. But,”\n","she continued, recollecting herself, “as we know none of the\n","particulars, it is not fair to condemn him. It is not to be supposed\n","that there was much affection in the case.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1217] “That is not an unnatural surmise,” said Fitzwilliam; “but it is\n","lessening the honour of my cousin’s triumph very sadly.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1218] This was spoken jestingly, but it appeared to her so just a picture of\n","Mr. Darcy, that she would not trust herself with an answer; and,\n","therefore, abruptly changing the conversation, talked on indifferent\n","matters till they reached the Parsonage. There, shut into her own room,\n","as soon as their visitor left them, she could think without interruption\n","of all that she had heard. It was not to be supposed that any other\n","people could be meant than those with whom she was connected. There\n","could not exist in the world _two_ men over whom Mr. Darcy could have\n","such boundless influence. That he had been concerned in the measures\n","taken to separate Mr. Bingley and Jane, she had never doubted; but she\n","had always attributed to Miss Bingley the principal design and\n","arrangement of them. If his own vanity, however, did not mislead him,\n","_he_ was the cause--his pride and caprice were the cause--of all that\n","Jane had suffered, and still continued to suffer. He had ruined for a\n","while every hope of happiness for the most affectionate, generous heart\n","in the world; and no one could say how lasting an evil he might have\n","inflicted.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1219] “There were some very strong objections against the lady,” were Colonel\n","Fitzwilliam’s words; and these strong objections probably were, her\n","having one uncle who was a country attorney, and another who was in\n","business in London.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1220] “To Jane herself,” she exclaimed, “there could be no possibility of\n","objection,--all loveliness and goodness as she is! Her understanding\n","excellent, her mind improved, and her manners captivating. Neither could\n","anything be urged against my father, who, though with some\n","peculiarities, has abilities which Mr. Darcy himself need not disdain,\n","and respectability which he will probably never reach.” When she thought\n","of her mother, indeed, her confidence gave way a little; but she would\n","not allow that any objections _there_ had material weight with Mr.\n","Darcy, whose pride, she was convinced, would receive a deeper wound from\n","the want of importance in his friend’s connections than from their want\n","of sense; and she was quite decided, at last, that he had been partly\n","governed by this worst kind of pride, and partly by the wish of\n","retaining Mr. Bingley for his sister.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1221] The agitation and tears which the subject occasioned brought on a\n","headache; and it grew so much worse towards the evening that, added to\n","her unwillingness to see Mr. Darcy, it determined her not to attend her\n","cousins to Rosings, where they were engaged to drink tea. Mrs. Collins,\n","seeing that she was really unwell, did not press her to go, and as much\n","as possible prevented her husband from pressing her; but Mr. Collins\n","could not conceal his apprehension of Lady Catherine’s being rather\n","displeased by her staying at home.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1222] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1223] CHAPTER XXXIV.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1224] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1225] When they were gone, Elizabeth, as if intending to exasperate herself as\n","much as possible against Mr. Darcy, chose for her employment the\n","examination of all the letters which Jane had written to her since her\n","being in Kent. They contained no actual complaint, nor was there any\n","revival of past occurrences, or any communication of present suffering.\n","But in all, and in almost every line of each, there was a want of that\n","cheerfulness which had been used to characterize her style, and which,\n","proceeding from the serenity of a mind at ease with itself, and kindly\n","disposed towards everyone, had been scarcely ever clouded. Elizabeth\n","noticed every sentence conveying the idea of uneasiness, with an\n","attention which it had hardly received on the first perusal. Mr. Darcy’s\n","shameful boast of what misery he had been able to inflict gave her a\n","keener sense of her sister’s sufferings. It was some consolation to\n","think that his visit to Rosings was to end on the day after the next,\n","and a still greater that in less than a fortnight she should herself be\n","with Jane again, and enabled to contribute to the recovery of her\n","spirits, by all that affection could do.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1226] She could not think of Darcy’s leaving Kent without remembering that his\n","cousin was to go with him; but Colonel Fitzwilliam had made it clear\n","that he had no intentions at all, and, agreeable as he was, she did not\n","mean to be unhappy about him.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1227] While settling this point, she was suddenly roused by the sound of the\n","door-bell; and her spirits were a little fluttered by the idea of its\n","being Colonel Fitzwilliam himself, who had once before called late in\n","the evening, and might now come to inquire particularly after her. But\n","this idea was soon banished, and her spirits were very differently\n","affected, when, to her utter amazement, she saw Mr. Darcy walk into the\n","room. In a hurried manner he immediately began an inquiry after her\n","health, imputing his visit to a wish of hearing that she were better.\n","She answered him with cold civility. He sat down for a few moments, and\n","then getting up walked about the room. Elizabeth was surprised, but\n","said not a word. After a silence of several minutes, he came towards her\n","in an agitated manner, and thus began:--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1228] “In vain have I struggled. It will not do. My feelings will not be\n","repressed. You must allow me to tell you how ardently I admire and love\n","you.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1229] Elizabeth’s astonishment was beyond expression. She stared, coloured,\n","doubted, and was silent. This he considered sufficient encouragement,\n","and the avowal of all that he felt and had long felt for her immediately\n","followed. He spoke well; but there were feelings besides those of the\n","heart to be detailed, and he was not more eloquent on the subject of\n","tenderness than of pride. His sense of her inferiority, of its being a\n","degradation, of the family obstacles which judgment had always opposed\n","to inclination, were dwelt on with a warmth which seemed due to the\n","consequence he was wounding, but was very unlikely to recommend his\n","suit.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1230] In spite of her deeply-rooted dislike, she could not be insensible to\n","the compliment of such a man’s affection, and though her intentions did\n","not vary for an instant, she was at first sorry for the pain he was to\n","receive; till roused to resentment by his subsequent language, she lost\n","all compassion in anger. She tried, however, to compose herself to\n","answer him with patience, when he should have done. He concluded with\n","representing to her the strength of that attachment which in spite of\n","all his endeavours he had found impossible to conquer; and with\n","expressing his hope that it would now be rewarded by her acceptance of\n","his hand. As he said this she could easily see that he had no doubt of a\n","favourable answer. He _spoke_ of apprehension and anxiety, but his\n","countenance expressed real security. Such a circumstance could only\n","exasperate farther; and when he ceased the colour rose into her cheeks\n","and she said,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1231] “In such cases as this, it is, I believe, the established mode to\n","express a sense of obligation for the sentiments avowed, however\n","unequally they may be returned. It is natural that obligation should be\n","felt, and if I could _feel_ gratitude, I would now thank you. But I\n","cannot--I have never desired your good opinion, and you have certainly\n","bestowed it most unwillingly. I am sorry to have occasioned pain to\n","anyone. It has been most unconsciously done, however, and I hope will be\n","of short duration. The feelings which you tell me have long prevented\n","the acknowledgment of your regard can have little difficulty in\n","overcoming it after this explanation.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1232] Mr. Darcy, who was leaning against the mantel-piece with his eyes fixed\n","on her face, seemed to catch her words with no less resentment than\n","surprise. His complexion became pale with anger, and the disturbance of\n","his mind was visible in every feature. He was struggling for the\n","appearance of composure, and would not open his lips till he believed\n","himself to have attained it. The pause was to Elizabeth’s feelings\n","dreadful. At length, in a voice of forced calmness, he said,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1233] “And this is all the reply which I am to have the honour of expecting! I\n","might, perhaps, wish to be informed why, with so little _endeavour_ at\n","civility, I am thus rejected. But it is of small importance.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1234] “I might as well inquire,” replied she, “why, with so evident a design\n","of offending and insulting me, you chose to tell me that you liked me\n","against your will, against your reason, and even against your character?\n","Was not this some excuse for incivility, if I _was_ uncivil? But I have\n","other provocations. You know I have. Had not my own feelings decided\n","against you, had they been indifferent, or had they even been\n","favourable, do you think that any consideration would tempt me to accept\n","the man who has been the means of ruining, perhaps for ever, the\n","happiness of a most beloved sister?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1235] As she pronounced these words, Mr. Darcy changed colour; but the emotion\n","was short, and he listened without attempting to interrupt her while she\n","continued,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1236] “I have every reason in the world to think ill of you. No motive can\n","excuse the unjust and ungenerous part you acted _there_. You dare not,\n","you cannot deny that you have been the principal, if not the only means\n","of dividing them from each other, of exposing one to the censure of the\n","world for caprice and instability, the other to its derision for\n","disappointed hopes, and involving them both in misery of the acutest\n","kind.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1237] She paused, and saw with no slight indignation that he was listening\n","with an air which proved him wholly unmoved by any feeling of remorse.\n","He even looked at her with a smile of affected incredulity.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1238] “Can you deny that you have done it?” she repeated.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1239] With assumed tranquillity he then replied, “I have no wish of denying\n","that I did everything in my power to separate my friend from your\n","sister, or that I rejoice in my success. Towards _him_ I have been\n","kinder than towards myself.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1240] Elizabeth disdained the appearance of noticing this civil reflection,\n","but its meaning did not escape, nor was it likely to conciliate her.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1241] “But it is not merely this affair,” she continued, “on which my dislike\n","is founded. Long before it had taken place, my opinion of you was\n","decided. Your character was unfolded in the recital which I received\n","many months ago from Mr. Wickham. On this subject, what can you have to\n","say? In what imaginary act of friendship can you here defend yourself?\n","or under what misrepresentation can you here impose upon others?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1242] “You take an eager interest in that gentleman’s concerns,” said Darcy,\n","in a less tranquil tone, and with a heightened colour.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1243] “Who that knows what his misfortunes have been can help feeling an\n","interest in him?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1244] “His misfortunes!” repeated Darcy, contemptuously,--“yes, his\n","misfortunes have been great indeed.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1245] “And of your infliction,” cried Elizabeth, with energy; “You have\n","reduced him to his present state of poverty--comparative poverty. You\n","have withheld the advantages which you must know to have been designed\n","for him. You have deprived the best years of his life of that\n","independence which was no less his due than his desert. You have done\n","all this! and yet you can treat the mention of his misfortunes with\n","contempt and ridicule.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1246] “And this,” cried Darcy, as he walked with quick steps across the room,\n","“is your opinion of me! This is the estimation in which you hold me! I\n","thank you for explaining it so fully. My faults, according to this\n","calculation, are heavy indeed! But, perhaps,” added he, stopping in his\n","walk, and turning towards her, “these offences might have been\n","overlooked, had not your pride been hurt by my honest confession of the\n","scruples that had long prevented my forming any serious design. These\n","bitter accusations might have been suppressed, had I, with greater\n","policy, concealed my struggles, and flattered you into the belief of my\n","being impelled by unqualified, unalloyed inclination; by reason, by\n","reflection, by everything. But disguise of every sort is my abhorrence.\n","Nor am I ashamed of the feelings I related. They were natural and just.\n","Could you expect me to rejoice in the inferiority of your\n","connections?--to congratulate myself on the hope of relations whose\n","condition in life is so decidedly beneath my own?”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1247] Elizabeth felt herself growing more angry every moment; yet she tried to\n","the utmost to speak with composure when she said,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1248] “You are mistaken, Mr. Darcy, if you suppose that the mode of your\n","declaration affected me in any other way than as it spared me the\n","concern which I might have felt in refusing you, had you behaved in a\n","more gentlemanlike manner.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1249] She saw him start at this; but he said nothing, and she continued,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1250] “You could not have made me the offer of your hand in any possible way\n","that would have tempted me to accept it.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1251] Again his astonishment was obvious; and he looked at her with an\n","expression of mingled incredulity and mortification. She went on,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1252] “From the very beginning, from the first moment, I may almost say, of my\n","acquaintance with you, your manners impressing me with the fullest\n","belief of your arrogance, your conceit, and your selfish disdain of the\n","feelings of others, were such as to form that groundwork of\n","disapprobation, on which succeeding events have built so immovable a\n","dislike; and I had not known you a month before I felt that you were the\n","last man in the world whom I could ever be prevailed on to marry.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1253] “You have said quite enough, madam. I perfectly comprehend your\n","feelings, and have now only to be ashamed of what my own have been.\n","Forgive me for having taken up so much of your time, and accept my best\n","wishes for your health and happiness.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1254] And with these words he hastily left the room, and Elizabeth heard him\n","the next moment open the front door and quit the house. The tumult of\n","her mind was now painfully great. She knew not how to support herself,\n","and, from actual weakness, sat down and cried for half an hour. Her\n","astonishment, as she reflected on what had passed, was increased by\n","every review of it. That she should receive an offer of marriage from\n","Mr. Darcy! that he should have been in love with her for so many months!\n","so much in love as to wish to marry her in spite of all the objections\n","which had made him prevent his friend’s marrying her sister, and which\n","must appear at least with equal force in his own case, was almost\n","incredible! it was gratifying to have inspired unconsciously so strong\n","an affection. But his pride, his abominable pride, his shameless avowal\n","of what he had done with respect to Jane, his unpardonable assurance in\n","acknowledging, though he could not justify it, and the unfeeling manner\n","which he had mentioned Mr. Wickham, his cruelty towards whom he had not\n","attempted to deny, soon overcame the pity which the consideration of his\n","attachment had for a moment excited.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1255] She continued in very agitating reflections till the sound of Lady\n","Catherine’s carriage made her feel how unequal she was to encounter\n","Charlotte’s observation, and hurried her away to her room.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1256] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 1257] “Hearing herself called”\n","]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1258] CHAPTER XXXV.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1259] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1260] Elizabeth awoke the next morning to the same thoughts and meditations\n","which had at length closed her eyes. She could not yet recover from the\n","surprise of what had happened: it was impossible to think of anything\n","else; and, totally indisposed for employment, she resolved soon after\n","breakfast to indulge herself in air and exercise. She was proceeding\n","directly to her favourite walk, when the recollection of Mr. Darcy’s\n","sometimes coming there stopped her, and instead of entering the park,\n","she turned up the lane which led her farther from the turnpike road. The\n","park paling was still the boundary on one side, and she soon passed one\n","of the gates into the ground.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1261] After walking two or three times along that part of the lane, she was\n","tempted, by the pleasantness of the morning, to stop at the gates and\n","look into the park. The five weeks which she had now passed in Kent had\n","made a great difference in the country, and every day was adding to the\n","verdure of the early trees. She was on the point of continuing her\n","walk, when she caught a glimpse of a gentleman within the sort of grove\n","which edged the park: he was moving that way; and fearful of its being\n","Mr. Darcy, she was directly retreating. But the person who advanced was\n","now near enough to see her, and stepping forward with eagerness,\n","pronounced her name. She had turned away; but on hearing herself called,\n","though in a voice which proved it to be Mr. Darcy, she moved again\n","towards the gate. He had by that time reached it also; and, holding out\n","a letter, which she instinctively took, said, with a look of haughty\n","composure, “I have been walking in the grove some time, in the hope of\n","meeting you. Will you do me the honour of reading that letter?” and\n","then, with a slight bow, turned again into the plantation, and was soon\n","out of sight.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1262] With no expectation of pleasure, but with the strongest curiosity,\n","Elizabeth opened the letter, and to her still increasing wonder,\n","perceived an envelope containing two sheets of letter paper, written\n","quite through, in a very close hand. The envelope itself was likewise\n","full. Pursuing her way along the lane, she then began it. It was dated\n","from Rosings, at eight o’clock in the morning, and was as follows:--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1263] “Be not alarmed, madam, on receiving this letter, by the apprehension of\n","its containing any repetition of those sentiments, or renewal of those\n","offers, which were last night so disgusting to you. I write without any\n","intention of paining you, or humbling myself, by dwelling on wishes,\n","which, for the happiness of both, cannot be too soon forgotten; and the\n","effort which the formation and the perusal of this letter must occasion,\n","should have been spared, had not my character required it to be written\n","and read. You must, therefore, pardon the freedom with which I demand\n","your attention; your feelings, I know, will bestow it unwillingly, but I\n","demand it of your justice.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1264] “Two offences of a very different nature, and by no means of equal\n","magnitude, you last night laid to my charge. The first mentioned was,\n","that, regardless of the sentiments of either, I had detached Mr. Bingley\n","from your sister,--and the other, that I had, in defiance of various\n","claims, in defiance of honour and humanity, ruined the immediate\n","prosperity and blasted the prospects of Mr. Wickham. Wilfully and\n","wantonly to have thrown off the companion of my youth, the acknowledged\n","favourite of my father, a young man who had scarcely any other\n","dependence than on our patronage, and who had been brought up to expect\n","its exertion, would be a depravity, to which the separation of two young\n","persons whose affection could be the growth of only a few weeks, could\n","bear no comparison. But from the severity of that blame which was last\n","night so liberally bestowed, respecting each circumstance, I shall hope\n","to be in future secured, when the following account of my actions and\n","their motives has been read. If, in the explanation of them which is due\n","to myself, I am under the necessity of relating feelings which may be\n","offensive to yours, I can only say that I am sorry. The necessity must\n","be obeyed, and further apology would be absurd. I had not been long in\n","Hertfordshire before I saw, in common with others, that Bingley\n","preferred your elder sister to any other young woman in the country. But\n","it was not till the evening of the dance at Netherfield that I had any\n","apprehension of his feeling a serious attachment. I had often seen him\n","in love before. At that ball, while I had the honour of dancing with\n","you, I was first made acquainted, by Sir William Lucas’s accidental\n","information, that Bingley’s attentions to your sister had given rise to\n","a general expectation of their marriage. He spoke of it as a certain\n","event, of which the time alone could be undecided. From that moment I\n","observed my friend’s behaviour attentively; and I could then perceive\n","that his partiality for Miss Bennet was beyond what I had ever witnessed\n","in him. Your sister I also watched. Her look and manners were open,\n","cheerful, and engaging as ever, but without any symptom of peculiar\n","regard; and I remained convinced, from the evening’s scrutiny, that\n","though she received his attentions with pleasure, she did not invite\n","them by any participation of sentiment. If _you_ have not been mistaken\n","here, _I_ must have been in an error. Your superior knowledge of your\n","sister must make the latter probable. If it be so, if I have been misled\n","by such error to inflict pain on her, your resentment has not been\n","unreasonable. But I shall not scruple to assert, that the serenity of\n","your sister’s countenance and air was such as might have given the most\n","acute observer a conviction that, however amiable her temper, her heart\n","was not likely to be easily touched. That I was desirous of believing\n","her indifferent is certain; but I will venture to say that my\n","investigations and decisions are not usually influenced by my hopes or\n","fears. I did not believe her to be indifferent because I wished it; I\n","believed it on impartial conviction, as truly as I wished it in reason.\n","My objections to the marriage were not merely those which I last night\n","acknowledged to have required the utmost force of passion to put aside\n","in my own case; the want of connection could not be so great an evil to\n","my friend as to me. But there were other causes of repugnance; causes\n","which, though still existing, and existing to an equal degree in both\n","instances, I had myself endeavoured to forget, because they were not\n","immediately before me. These causes must be stated, though briefly. The\n","situation of your mother’s family, though objectionable, was nothing in\n","comparison of that total want of propriety so frequently, so almost\n","uniformly betrayed by herself, by your three younger sisters, and\n","occasionally even by your father:--pardon me,--it pains me to offend\n","you. But amidst your concern for the defects of your nearest relations,\n","and your displeasure at this representation of them, let it give you\n","consolation to consider that to have conducted yourselves so as to avoid\n","any share of the like censure is praise no less generally bestowed on\n","you and your eldest sister than it is honourable to the sense and\n","disposition of both. I will only say, farther, that from what passed\n","that evening my opinion of all parties was confirmed, and every\n","inducement heightened, which could have led me before to preserve my\n","friend from what I esteemed a most unhappy connection. He left\n","Netherfield for London on the day following, as you, I am certain,\n","remember, with the design of soon returning. The part which I acted is\n","now to be explained. His sisters’ uneasiness had been equally excited\n","with my own: our coincidence of feeling was soon discovered; and, alike\n","sensible that no time was to be lost in detaching their brother, we\n","shortly resolved on joining him directly in London. We accordingly\n","went--and there I readily engaged in the office of pointing out to my\n","friend the certain evils of such a choice. I described and enforced them\n","earnestly. But however this remonstrance might have staggered or delayed\n","his determination, I do not suppose that it would ultimately have\n","prevented the marriage, had it not been seconded by the assurance, which\n","I hesitated not in giving, of your sister’s indifference. He had before\n","believed her to return his affection with sincere, if not with equal,\n","regard. But Bingley has great natural modesty, with a stronger\n","dependence on my judgment than on his own. To convince him, therefore,\n","that he had deceived himself was no very difficult point. To persuade\n","him against returning into Hertfordshire, when that conviction had been\n","given, was scarcely the work of a moment. I cannot blame myself for\n","having done thus much. There is but one part of my conduct, in the whole\n","affair, on which I do not reflect with satisfaction; it is that I\n","condescended to adopt the measures of art so far as to conceal from him\n","your sister’s being in town. I knew it myself, as it was known to Miss\n","Bingley; but her brother is even yet ignorant of it. That they might\n","have met without ill consequence is, perhaps, probable; but his regard\n","did not appear to me enough extinguished for him to see her without some\n","danger. Perhaps this concealment, this disguise, was beneath me. It is\n","done, however, and it was done for the best. On this subject I have\n","nothing more to say, no other apology to offer. If I have wounded your\n","sister’s feelings, it was unknowingly done; and though the motives which\n","governed me may to you very naturally appear insufficient, I have not\n","yet learnt to condemn them.--With respect to that other, more weighty\n","accusation, of having injured Mr. Wickham, I can only refute it by\n","laying before you the whole of his connection with my family. Of what he\n","has _particularly_ accused me I am ignorant; but of the truth of what I\n","shall relate I can summon more than one witness of undoubted veracity.\n","Mr. Wickham is the son of a very respectable man, who had for many years\n","the management of all the Pemberley estates, and whose good conduct in\n","the discharge of his trust naturally inclined my father to be of service\n","to him; and on George Wickham, who was his godson, his kindness was\n","therefore liberally bestowed. My father supported him at school, and\n","afterwards at Cambridge; most important assistance, as his own father,\n","always poor from the extravagance of his wife, would have been unable to\n","give him a gentleman’s education. My father was not only fond of this\n","young man’s society, whose manners were always engaging, he had also the\n","highest opinion of him, and hoping the church would be his profession,\n","intended to provide for him in it. As for myself, it is many, many years\n","since I first began to think of him in a very different manner. The\n","vicious propensities, the want of principle, which he was careful to\n","guard from the knowledge of his best friend, could not escape the\n","observation of a young man of nearly the same age with himself, and who\n","had opportunities of seeing him in unguarded moments, which Mr. Darcy\n","could not have. Here again I shall give you pain--to what degree you\n","only can tell. But whatever may be the sentiments which Mr. Wickham has\n","created, a suspicion of their nature shall not prevent me from unfolding\n","his real character. It adds even another motive. My excellent father\n","died about five years ago; and his attachment to Mr. Wickham was to the\n","last so steady, that in his will he particularly recommended it to me to\n","promote his advancement in the best manner that his profession might\n","allow, and if he took orders, desired that a valuable family living\n","might be his as soon as it became vacant. There was also a legacy of\n","one thousand pounds. His own father did not long survive mine; and\n","within half a year from these events Mr. Wickham wrote to inform me\n","that, having finally resolved against taking orders, he hoped I should\n","not think it unreasonable for him to expect some more immediate\n","pecuniary advantage, in lieu of the preferment, by which he could not be\n","benefited. He had some intention, he added, of studying the law, and I\n","must be aware that the interest of one thousand pounds would be a very\n","insufficient support therein. I rather wished than believed him to be\n","sincere; but, at any rate, was perfectly ready to accede to his\n","proposal. I knew that Mr. Wickham ought not to be a clergyman. The\n","business was therefore soon settled. He resigned all claim to assistance\n","in the church, were it possible that he could ever be in a situation to\n","receive it, and accepted in return three thousand pounds. All connection\n","between us seemed now dissolved. I thought too ill of him to invite him\n","to Pemberley, or admit his society in town. In town, I believe, he\n","chiefly lived, but his studying the law was a mere pretence; and being\n","now free from all restraint, his life was a life of idleness and\n","dissipation. For about three years I heard little of him; but on the\n","decease of the incumbent of the living which had been designed for him,\n","he applied to me again by letter for the presentation. His\n","circumstances, he assured me, and I had no difficulty in believing it,\n","were exceedingly bad. He had found the law a most unprofitable study,\n","and was now absolutely resolved on being ordained, if I would present\n","him to the living in question--of which he trusted there could be little\n","doubt, as he was well assured that I had no other person to provide for,\n","and I could not have forgotten my revered father’s intentions. You will\n","hardly blame me for refusing to comply with this entreaty, or for\n","resisting every repetition of it. His resentment was in proportion to\n","the distress of his circumstances--and he was doubtless as violent in\n","his abuse of me to others as in his reproaches to myself. After this\n","period, every appearance of acquaintance was dropped. How he lived, I\n","know not. But last summer he was again most painfully obtruded on my\n","notice. I must now mention a circumstance which I would wish to forget\n","myself, and which no obligation less than the present should induce me\n","to unfold to any human being. Having said thus much, I feel no doubt of\n","your secrecy. My sister, who is more than ten years my junior, was left\n","to the guardianship of my mother’s nephew, Colonel Fitzwilliam, and\n","myself. About a year ago, she was taken from school, and an\n","establishment formed for her in London; and last summer she went with\n","the lady who presided over it to Ramsgate; and thither also went Mr.\n","Wickham, undoubtedly by design; for there proved to have been a prior\n","acquaintance between him and Mrs. Younge, in whose character we were\n","most unhappily deceived; and by her connivance and aid he so far\n","recommended himself to Georgiana, whose affectionate heart retained a\n","strong impression of his kindness to her as a child, that she was\n","persuaded to believe herself in love and to consent to an elopement. She\n","was then but fifteen, which must be her excuse; and after stating her\n","imprudence, I am happy to add, that I owed the knowledge of it to\n","herself. I joined them unexpectedly a day or two before the intended\n","elopement; and then Georgiana, unable to support the idea of grieving\n","and offending a brother whom she almost looked up to as a father,\n","acknowledged the whole to me. You may imagine what I felt and how I\n","acted. Regard for my sister’s credit and feelings prevented any public\n","exposure; but I wrote to Mr. Wickham, who left the place immediately,\n","and Mrs. Younge was of course removed from her charge. Mr. Wickham’s\n","chief object was unquestionably my sister’s fortune, which is thirty\n","thousand pounds; but I cannot help supposing that the hope of revenging\n","himself on me was a strong inducement. His revenge would have been\n","complete indeed. This, madam, is a faithful narrative of every event in\n","which we have been concerned together; and if you do not absolutely\n","reject it as false, you will, I hope, acquit me henceforth of cruelty\n","towards Mr. Wickham. I know not in what manner, under what form of\n","falsehood, he has imposed on you; but his success is not perhaps to be\n","wondered at, ignorant as you previously were of everything concerning\n","either. Detection could not be in your power, and suspicion certainly\n","not in your inclination. You may possibly wonder why all this was not\n","told you last night. But I was not then master enough of myself to know\n","what could or ought to be revealed. For the truth of everything here\n","related, I can appeal more particularly to the testimony of Colonel\n","Fitzwilliam, who, from our near relationship and constant intimacy, and\n","still more as one of the executors of my father’s will, has been\n","unavoidably acquainted with every particular of these transactions. If\n","your abhorrence of _me_ should make _my_ assertions valueless, you\n","cannot be prevented by the same cause from confiding in my cousin; and\n","that there may be the possibility of consulting him, I shall endeavour\n","to find some opportunity of putting this letter in your hands in the\n","course of the morning. I will only add, God bless you.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1265] “FITZWILLIAM DARCY.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1266] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1267] CHAPTER XXXVI.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1268] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1269] Elizabeth, when Mr. Darcy gave her the letter, did not expect it to\n","contain a renewal of his offers, she had formed no expectation at all of\n","its contents. But such as they were, it may be well supposed how eagerly\n","she went through them, and what a contrariety of emotion they excited.\n","Her feelings as she read were scarcely to be defined. With amazement did\n","she first understand that he believed any apology to be in his power;\n","and steadfastly was she persuaded, that he could have no explanation to\n","give, which a just sense of shame would not conceal. With a strong\n","prejudice against everything he might say, she began his account of\n","what had happened at Netherfield. She read with an eagerness which\n","hardly left her power of comprehension; and from impatience of knowing\n","what the next sentence might bring, was incapable of attending to the\n","sense of the one before her eyes. His belief of her sister’s\n","insensibility she instantly resolved to be false; and his account of the\n","real, the worst objections to the match, made her too angry to have any\n","wish of doing him justice. He expressed no regret for what he had done\n","which satisfied her; his style was not penitent, but haughty. It was all\n","pride and insolence.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1270] But when this subject was succeeded by his account of Mr. Wickham--when\n","she read, with somewhat clearer attention, a relation of events which,\n","if true, must overthrow every cherished opinion of his worth, and which\n","bore so alarming an affinity to his own history of himself--her feelings\n","were yet more acutely painful and more difficult of definition.\n","Astonishment, apprehension, and even horror, oppressed her. She wished\n","to discredit it entirely, repeatedly exclaiming, “This must be false!\n","This cannot be! This must be the grossest falsehood!”--and when she had\n","gone through the whole letter, though scarcely knowing anything of the\n","last page or two, put it hastily away, protesting that she would not\n","regard it, that she would never look in it again.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1271] In this perturbed state of mind, with thoughts that could rest on\n","nothing, she walked on; but it would not do: in half a minute the letter\n","was unfolded again; and collecting herself as well as she could, she\n","again began the mortifying perusal of all that related to Wickham, and\n","commanded herself so far as to examine the meaning of every sentence.\n","The account of his connection with the Pemberley family was exactly\n","what he had related himself; and the kindness of the late Mr. Darcy,\n","though she had not before known its extent, agreed equally well with his\n","own words. So far each recital confirmed the other; but when she came to\n","the will, the difference was great. What Wickham had said of the living\n","was fresh in her memory; and as she recalled his very words, it was\n","impossible not to feel that there was gross duplicity on one side or the\n","other, and, for a few moments, she flattered herself that her wishes did\n","not err. But when she read and re-read, with the closest attention, the\n","particulars immediately following of Wickham’s resigning all pretensions\n","to the living, of his receiving in lieu so considerable a sum as three\n","thousand pounds, again was she forced to hesitate. She put down the\n","letter, weighed every circumstance with what she meant to be\n","impartiality--deliberated on the probability of each statement--but with\n","little success. On both sides it was only assertion. Again she read on.\n","But every line proved more clearly that the affair, which she had\n","believed it impossible that any contrivance could so represent as to\n","render Mr. Darcy’s conduct in it less than infamous, was capable of a\n","turn which must make him entirely blameless throughout the whole.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1272] The extravagance and general profligacy which he scrupled not to lay to\n","Mr. Wickham’s charge exceedingly shocked her; the more so, as she could\n","bring no proof of its injustice. She had never heard of him before his\n","entrance into the ----shire militia, in which he had engaged at the\n","persuasion of the young man, who, on meeting him accidentally in town,\n","had there renewed a slight acquaintance. Of his former way of life,\n","nothing had been known in Hertfordshire but what he told\n","\n","[Paragraph 1273] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 1274] “Meeting accidentally in Town”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1275] [_Copyright 1894 by George Allen._]]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1276] himself. As to his real character, had information been in her power,\n","she had never felt a wish of inquiring. His countenance, voice, and\n","manner, had established him at once in the possession of every virtue.\n","She tried to recollect some instance of goodness, some distinguished\n","trait of integrity or benevolence, that might rescue him from the\n","attacks of Mr. Darcy; or at least, by the predominance of virtue, atone\n","for those casual errors, under which she would endeavour to class what\n","Mr. Darcy had described as the idleness and vice of many years’\n","continuance. But no such recollection befriended her. She could see him\n","instantly before her, in every charm of air and address, but she could\n","remember no more substantial good than the general approbation of the\n","neighbourhood, and the regard which his social powers had gained him in\n","the mess. After pausing on this point a considerable while, she once\n","more continued to read. But, alas! the story which followed, of his\n","designs on Miss Darcy, received some confirmation from what had passed\n","between Colonel Fitzwilliam and herself only the morning before; and at\n","last she was referred for the truth of every particular to Colonel\n","Fitzwilliam himself--from whom she had previously received the\n","information of his near concern in all his cousin’s affairs and whose\n","character she had no reason to question. At one time she had almost\n","resolved on applying to him, but the idea was checked by the awkwardness\n","of the application, and at length wholly banished by the conviction that\n","Mr. Darcy would never have hazarded such a proposal, if he had not been\n","well assured of his cousin’s corroboration.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1277] She perfectly remembered everything that had passed in conversation\n","between Wickham and herself in their first evening at Mr. Philips’s.\n","Many of his expressions were still fresh in her memory. She was _now_\n","struck with the impropriety of such communications to a stranger, and\n","wondered it had escaped her before. She saw the indelicacy of putting\n","himself forward as he had done, and the inconsistency of his professions\n","with his conduct. She remembered that he had boasted of having no fear\n","of seeing Mr. Darcy--that Mr. Darcy might leave the country, but that\n","_he_ should stand his ground; yet he had avoided the Netherfield ball\n","the very next week. She remembered, also, that till the Netherfield\n","family had quitted the country, he had told his story to no one but\n","herself; but that after their removal, it had been everywhere discussed;\n","that he had then no reserves, no scruples in sinking Mr. Darcy’s\n","character, though he had assured her that respect for the father would\n","always prevent his exposing the son.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1278] How differently did everything now appear in which he was concerned! His\n","attentions to Miss King were now the consequence of views solely and\n","hatefully mercenary; and the mediocrity of her fortune proved no longer\n","the moderation of his wishes, but his eagerness to grasp at anything.\n","His behaviour to herself could now have had no tolerable motive: he had\n","either been deceived with regard to her fortune, or had been gratifying\n","his vanity by encouraging the preference which she believed she had most\n","incautiously shown. Every lingering struggle in his favour grew fainter\n","and fainter; and in further justification of Mr. Darcy, she could not\n","but allow that Mr. Bingley, when questioned by Jane, had long ago\n","asserted his blamelessness in the affair;--that, proud and repulsive as\n","were his manners, she had never, in the whole course of their\n","acquaintance--an acquaintance which had latterly brought them much\n","together, and given her a sort of intimacy with his ways--seen anything\n","that betrayed him to be unprincipled or unjust--anything that spoke him\n","of irreligious or immoral habits;--that among his own connections he was\n","esteemed and valued;--that even Wickham had allowed him merit as a\n","brother, and that she had often heard him speak so affectionately of his\n","sister as to prove him capable of some amiable feeling;--that had his\n","actions been what Wickham represented them, so gross a violation of\n","everything right could hardly have been concealed from the world; and\n","that friendship between a person capable of it and such an amiable man\n","as Mr. Bingley was incomprehensible.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1279] She grew absolutely ashamed of herself. Of neither Darcy nor Wickham\n","could she think, without feeling that she had been blind, partial,\n","prejudiced, absurd.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1280] “How despicably have I acted!” she cried. “I, who have prided myself on\n","my discernment! I, who have valued myself on my abilities! who have\n","often disdained the generous candour of my sister, and gratified my\n","vanity in useless or blameless distrust. How humiliating is this\n","discovery! Yet, how just a humiliation! Had I been in love, I could not\n","have been more wretchedly blind. But vanity, not love, has been my\n","folly. Pleased with the preference of one, and offended by the neglect\n","of the other, on the very beginning of our acquaintance, I have courted\n","prepossession and ignorance, and driven reason away where either were\n","concerned. Till this moment, I never knew myself.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1281] From herself to Jane, from Jane to Bingley, her thoughts were in a line\n","which soon brought to her recollection that Mr. Darcy’s explanation\n","_there_ had appeared very insufficient; and she read it again. Widely\n","different was the effect of a second perusal. How could she deny that\n","credit to his assertions, in one instance, which she had been obliged to\n","give in the other? He declared himself to have been totally unsuspicious\n","of her sister’s attachment; and she could not help remembering what\n","Charlotte’s opinion had always been. Neither could she deny the justice\n","of his description of Jane. She felt that Jane’s feelings, though\n","fervent, were little displayed, and that there was a constant\n","complacency in her air and manner, not often united with great\n","sensibility.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1282] When she came to that part of the letter in which her family were\n","mentioned, in tones of such mortifying, yet merited, reproach, her sense\n","of shame was severe. The justice of the charge struck her too forcibly\n","for denial; and the circumstances to which he particularly alluded, as\n","having passed at the Netherfield ball, and as confirming all his first\n","disapprobation, could not have made a stronger impression on his mind\n","than on hers.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1283] The compliment to herself and her sister was not unfelt. It soothed, but\n","it could not console her for the contempt which had been thus\n","self-attracted by the rest of her family; and as she considered that\n","Jane’s disappointment had, in fact, been the work of her nearest\n","relations, and reflected how materially the credit of both must be hurt\n","by such impropriety of conduct, she felt depressed beyond anything she\n","had ever known before.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1284] After wandering along the lane for two hours, giving way to every\n","variety of thought, reconsidering events, determining probabilities, and\n","reconciling herself, as well as she could, to a change so sudden and so\n","important, fatigue, and a recollection of her long absence, made her at\n","length return home; and she entered the house with the wish of appearing\n","cheerful as usual, and the resolution of repressing such reflections as\n","must make her unfit for conversation.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1285] She was immediately told, that the two gentlemen from Rosings had each\n","called during her absence; Mr. Darcy, only for a few minutes, to take\n","leave, but that Colonel Fitzwilliam had been sitting with them at least\n","an hour, hoping for her return, and almost resolving to walk after her\n","till she could be found. Elizabeth could but just _affect_ concern in\n","missing him; she really rejoiced at it. Colonel Fitzwilliam was no\n","longer an object. She could think only of her letter.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1286] [Illustration:\n","\n","[Paragraph 1287] “His parting obeisance”\n","]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1288] CHAPTER XXXVII.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1289] [Illustration]\n","\n","[Paragraph 1290] The two gentlemen left Rosings the next morning; and Mr. Collins having\n","been in waiting near the lodges, to make them his parting obeisance, was\n","able to bring home the pleasing intelligence of their appearing in very\n","good health, and in as tolerable spirits as could be expected, after the\n","melancholy scene so lately gone through at Rosings. To Rosings he then\n","hastened to console Lady Catherine and her daughter; and on his return\n","brought back, with great satisfaction, a message from her Ladyship,\n","importing that she felt herself so dull as to make her very desirous of\n","having them all to dine with her.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1291] Elizabeth could not see Lady Catherine without recollecting that, had\n","she chosen it, she might by this time have been presented to her as her\n","future niece; nor could she think, without a smile, of what her\n","Ladyship’s indignation would have been. “What would she have said? how\n","would she have behaved?” were the questions with which she amused\n","herself.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1292] Their first subject was the diminution of the Rosings’ party. “I assure\n","you, I feel it exceedingly,” said Lady Catherine; “I believe nobody\n","feels the loss of friends so much as I do. But I am particularly\n","attached to these young men; and know them to be so much attached to me!\n","They were excessively sorry to go! But so they always are. The dear\n","Colonel rallied his spirits tolerably till just at last; but Darcy\n","seemed to feel it most acutely--more, I think, than last year. His\n","attachment to Rosings certainly increases.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1293] Mr. Collins had a compliment and an allusion to throw in here, which\n","were kindly smiled on by the mother and daughter.\n","\n","[Paragraph 1294] Lady Catherine observed, after dinner, that Miss Bennet seemed out of\n","spirits; and immediately accounting for it herself, by supposing that\n","she did not like to go home again so soon, she added,--\n","\n","[Paragraph 1295] “But if that is the case, you must write to your mother to beg that you\n","may stay a little longer. Mrs. Collins will be very glad of your\n","company, I am sure.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1296] “I am much obliged to your Ladyship for your kind invitation,” replied\n","Elizabeth; “but it is not in my power to accept it. I must be in town\n","next Saturday.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1297] “Why, at that rate, you will have been here only six weeks. I expected\n","you to stay two months. I told Mrs. Collins so before you came. There\n","can be no occasion for your going so soon. Mrs. Bennet could certainly\n","spare you for another fortnight.”\n","\n","[Paragraph 1298] “But my father cannot.
